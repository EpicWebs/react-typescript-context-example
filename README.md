# react-typescript-context-example

## Building the file
- npm run install
- npm run start

## Important Files
Everything is inside /src/
/components/ just contain the components and have two nested components, list and item.
/context/ contains a reducer and context file. You can setup actions to dispatch updates

I've put a button inside the item to update the context.
